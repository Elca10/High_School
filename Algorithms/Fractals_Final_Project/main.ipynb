    "#### What is a Fractal?\n",
    "A fractal is a repetitive, geometric design that never ends. Not any infinite design is a fractal, however. It needs to have some aspect of *self-similarity*, which means that it contains a smaller copy of itself. \n",

    "If a fractal is repeating the same thing over and over again, how can we know what exactly we're looking at? With each level of self-similarity, a couple things changes.\n",
    "First, the order (or depth) changes. The order is essentially how zoomed in you are. It can also be thought of as what \"level\" you're looking at. For example, the order of the very first instance of the pattern is 0, and the next level would have order = 1. \n",

I'll include some examples of what you can make using similar functions at the end of this project."

    "Fractals, whether they're represented mathematically or visually, are fascinating to explore. And they're not just fun to play with - they're also useful. They're used in other subjects like finance, physics, and (obviously) computer graphics. They can even be used to model many natural landmarks, like mountains. Isn't it strange to think that recursion even happens in nature? I personally will never look at a fern the same way again. \n",
